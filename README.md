# Front-end challenge: Delivery app client

## Instructions to run the app in a development environment
- Clone the server and client repositories:

- Install server dependencies and run it:

    `~/delivery-app-server$ npm install`
    
    `~/delivery-app-server$ node index.js`
    
- Install client dependencies and run it
    
    `~/delivery-app-client$ npm install`
    
    `~/delivery-app-client$ npm run start`


- Access the client in the browser in the following URL:

    `http//:localhost:3000`
    
- The login credentials for the mockup users are in the file `delivery-app-server/helper/users-data.json`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

Runs the NodeJS server

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
